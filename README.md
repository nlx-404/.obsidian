# 📝 Obsidian Setup 

# Theme
The theme I am using can be found in the `theme` folder. It is originally the dracula theme but modified a lot by me.

# Plugins
The plugins I use are:
- **Banners** (Display a banner at the top of the page)
- **Calendar** (Calendar widget in sidebar)
- **Dataview** (To create a table of my modified files in the past 7 days)
- **Iconize** (To give folders and files icons)
- **Kanban** (To create and view my overall tasks)
